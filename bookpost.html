        <p class="font2">Books allow you to see things from a completely different perspective. Reading a book about a certain culture, for example, can help you to understand how that culture differs from your own. You might not agree with that culture’s perspective, but at least you’ll look at things from a new angle.

            Books give you new ideas. You’re constantly learning when you’re reading, and you can start to look at the world from a more balanced perspective. In the absence of other viewpoints, we tend to have a very one-dimensional type of thinking based on our upbringing.
            
            We act the way we do because that’s what we learned during our formative years. We look at things from the angle of our own experience. Using this lens, it is easy to assume that our way is the correct way. Books can help us see things in a new light, allowing us to let go of the notions of “correct” or “incorrect” and seeing instead different ways of being human.
            
            Take, for example, the image of a Muslim woman wearing a burka or hijab. A lot of people in Western society may view this as a type of oppression. In reality, however, many Muslim women choose to dress in this manner as a part of their spiritual beliefs.
            
            If you were to read a book or article on the matter written by a Muslim woman, you could learn to start seeing things from her perspective. It’s a big world out there, and reading is one way to expand your mind to all the possibilities.
            
            Conclusion
            
            Books are amazing things that can be both entertaining and beneficial to your health. They are almost like tools to a healthy lifestyle. Those who don’t read can’t understand the love for reading, but those who read on a daily basis know the importance of diving into a good book. The books that you choose to read is your preference, which can range from romance to non-fiction. Often, people will read magazine articles or even textbooks if that is what they enjoy reading. Whatever you choose to read, you can count on the multiple benefits of reading to help both your mind and body.
            
            Books on a shelfIt is easy to enjoy books when you are merely reading for pleasure. Heavy readers will always have a book in their hands as well. As a reader, you probably don’t think of the great benefits of reading either, but they are there even when you don’t realise it. From stress relief to improved memory, reading is hugely beneficial in all aspects of our lives. Reading is a great way to improve yourself all around.
            
            You can find books anywhere, from the library to bookstores to thrift shops. It’s easy to seek out books that interests you. In fact, you can find books everywhere. If you aren’t sure where to find the best books, magazines or other literary works, all you have to do is type in a simple google search. The options of books or magazines to read are limitless.

And if mystical stories of fantasy, romance, and tall tales are your cup of tea, then give fiction a chance.
            
            If you aren’t an avid reader already, give it a shot. Reading might seem boring to some who have never truly read a great piece, but with a little time, you can love reading as well.
